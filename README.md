ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Madie

I am a student at Canberra Grammar School in Grade 10. I have been coding for 4 years, learning a few different languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and C+). I have worked on projects involving web development (front and back end), and have also worked with Arduino to create many mini projects. I have studied web security and participated in multiple CTFs, including the upcoming BSides event.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in IT, Music, Basketball and Science.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Machine Learning

Projects that I am currently working on include: 
- Coding an RC car
- Creating a machine learning portfolio
